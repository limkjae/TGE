Problem Description
Earthquake is typically demonstrated by stick-slip motion in laboratory. Although experiments successfully describes substantial mechanism of earthquake, it has been not enough to reproduce natural earthquake since typical experiments only have single degree of freedom while natural earthquakes occurs on two dimensional fault plane with complexly distributed frictional properties. Increasing dimension of laboratory stick-slip would show a lot further information such as slip behavior on a plain with series of different frictional properties, earthquake nucleation, stress and slip purse propagation and so on. However, although there are several recent successful observations for laboratory induced multi-dimensional slip, the experiments are expensive and also requires huge care because rock is too stiff so deformations becomes too tiny to be measured and large dimension of rock mass and apparatus are required.
